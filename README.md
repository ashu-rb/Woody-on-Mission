# Woody-on-Mission
A game for children where they will be rewarded points for assigned tasks using NFT.

## Inspiration
We all have experienced boring chores given by our parents. Very often children forget to complete their daily work, so to remind them to finish their daily missions on time we wanted to gamify that experience. What better than NFTs and a Social Media Post that makes your Mr/Ms Popular among your friends

## What it does
It will help parents to assign the missions so that children can complete them and get rewards using NFT.
They get points which unlock different levels of NFTs. Currently we have implemented 3 levels of NFT rewards for 20, 40 and 60 points respectively. 
They can also post about their achievement on WhatsApp, Facebook, Twitter and of course Deso's own Social Media App.

## How we built it
Mainly website using MERN Stack with MongoDB Database
1. Frontend using ReactJS, backend Using NodeJS and database MongoDB
2. DeSo to give rewards points using NFT blockchain
3. Task Completion update is sent to the parents email ID using SendGrid API by Twilio

## Domain Name from GoDaddy Registry
GoDaddy has been used to get a custom domain - woodyonmission.co

## Challenges we ran into
It was our first time using MongoDB. This had a steep curve of learning by was indeed very fun to use. Time was also a major challenge.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We managed to get the project going within the time and we were able to integrate DeSo, Twilio to our backend together. This felt really satisfying in addition to learning MongoDB from scratch!

## What we learned
Learnt to work with new technologies within such a short time and integrating them together

## What's next for Woody On Mission
1. Providing a channel to add updates
2. Allowing parents to verify that tasks have been completed
3. Adding more levels
